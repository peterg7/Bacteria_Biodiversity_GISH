# Bacteria Biodiversity

## Overview
A biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory is responsible for discovering and documenting the many bacterial species that are not well studied or unknown to scientists. The researcher is particularly interested in species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Many other labs and researchers are looking into this as well but this researcher has a hypothesis that the perfect microorganism can be found on the human body. The belief is that the bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button. To test the hypothesis, samples have been collected from the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that collect in our belly buttons. With this data, the researcher wants to build a dashboard that she can share with participants and fellow researchers. 

## Resources
Software:
- Anaconda 4.7.12

## Summary
Using plotly and D3, created a dynamic webpage with a selector for the volunteer's ID. Based upon the selection, the demographic info panel will update and display the metadata for the selected volunteer. Because the data is stored as a `JSON` file stored locally, in order to share the dashboard with other people, the project was uploaded to GitHub Pages to be run on a GitHub server. 

## Challenge Overview
With the completion of the demographic information panel, the researcher now wants to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. This should include a bar chart for the top ten bacterial species and a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the species found in the volunteer's navel. There should also be a gauge chart to show the volunteer's belly button washing frequency. 

## Challenge Summary
The addition of the three charts makes the dashboard much more digestible to other viewers. In this format, the webpage can be shared with the public and easily understood by the original volunteers as well as other researchers interested in the data.
